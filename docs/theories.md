#What is an Algorithm?
- In simple words, Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. 
Example would be following a recipe while cooking, here we follow steps to ensure that our food is cooked appropriatley with proper ingridents. 

In aspect of computer programming let us consider a problem where we had to add two numbers. In this case we visualise and refer to the inputs as our Ingredients, steps including addition and returning the value as our algorithm and output as the sum of two numbers.


Characterictics of an Algorithms 
- An algo should have well defined inputs and outputs.
- Each step should be clear and unambiguous. 
- Algorithm should be language independent, meaning it should be written in such a way that same concept can be reitrated in different programming language. 


Why Algorithms?

As we progress we consitently encounter problems that needs to be solved and learning algorithms enables us to use different problem solving techniques to efficiently solve those problems.
Not only these Algorithms provides us a clear perspective on how one problem can be solved in many ways using different Algorithms. 
While every Algorithms comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.


How to measure performance of an Algorithm?
- Let's dive into an example first there are tons of different ways on how we can sort a list of numbers. 
The main concept for us to understand is whether the particuar approach we have used is counted as the most effecient algorithm.
Generally, when we talk about the performance in real life, we use an absolute measure. 
For example: If I take 15 seconds to complete a lap race of 100m, someone else might be able to finish within 12 seconds. 

However, in the case of Algorithms running time cannot be directly predicted as it depends on a number of factors.

- It can change on the basis of programming language that we use to implement the Algorithm.

- The computer that the programme is running on.

- Other programms running concurrently at the same time. 

- The quality of the operating system.

Bearing these factors in mind, we generally evaluate the performance of an algorithm based on its input size.

The evalutaion is of two types:
1) Time Complexity: The amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size. 

2) Space Complexity:  The amount of memory taken by an Algorithm to run, as a function input size. 


By evalutaing against the input size, the analysis is not only just machine independent but the comparison if also more appropriate.


Some factors to consider are:
- If our application needs to be very quick and has plenty of memory to work with, we do not have to worry about space complexity. 
- If our app has liitle memory to work with, we should pick a solution that is relatively slower but can work easily with the availability of less space.


We represent time and space complexity using Asymptotic notaions, which are mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity.

There are 3 main Asymptotic notations:
1) Big-O-notation (O-notation)- Worst Case Complexity.

2) Omega notation (Î©-notation) - Best case complexity. 

3) Theta notation (0-notation) - Average case complexity.


The 1st step in being more pracitical is to not worry about the Best case and the Average case complexity. As we deal with problems we identify that we primairly concerned with worst case scenarios of an Algorithms.





#Big-O-Notation


Algoirthms are classified in four categories:


1)Math Algorithms
2)Sort
3)Search
4) Miscellanous Algorithms and problem solving

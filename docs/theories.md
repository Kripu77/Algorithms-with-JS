What is an Algorithm?
- In simple words, Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. 
Example would be following a recipe while cooking, here we follow steps to ensure that our food is cooked appropriatley with proper ingridents. 

In aspect of computer programming let us consider a problem where we had to add two numbers. In this case we visualise and refer to the inputs as our Ingredients, steps including addition and returning the value as our algorithm and output as the sum of two numbers.


Characterictics of an Algorithms 
- An algo should have well defined inputs and outputs.
- Each setp should be clear and unambiguous. 
- Algorithm should be language independent, meaning it should be written in such a way that same concept can be reitrated in different programming language. 


Why Algorithms?
As we progress we consitently encounter problems that needs to be solved and learning algorithms enables us to use different problem solving techniques to efficiently solve those problems.
Not only these Algorithms provides us a clear perspective on how one problem can be solved in many ways using different Algorithms. 
While every Algorithms comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.

How to measure performance of an Algorithm?


Time & Space Complexity of Algorithms



Big-O-Notation


Algoirthms are classified in four categories:


1)Math Algorithms
2)Sort
3)Search
4) Miscellanous Algorithms and problem solving
